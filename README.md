# Lab 5: Using Web APIs
### Issues Encountered, and Steps I Took to Rectify Them
While creating the constructor, I had some difficulties interpreting the documentation on the GitHub page for the API. While there are some examples of methods to initialize the LyricScraper, I found myself having to logically retrace the steps of each statement to fully understand them. After some trial-and-error, I managed to figure out how the search function works - and after verifying that the constructor included a client instance, search request instance, search method of the client instance that accepted the request instance as an argument, and a way to display the results in the console, I had an async Task that returned lyric sets as expected.
