# Lab 5: Using Web APIs
### Issues Encountered, and Steps I Took to Rectify Them
- While creating the constructor, I had some difficulties interpreting the documentation on the GitHub page for the API. While there are some examples of methods to initialize the LyricScraper, I found myself having to logically retrace the steps of each statement to fully understand them. After some trial-and-error, I managed to figure out how the search function works - and after verifying that the constructor included a client instance, search request instance, search method of the client instance that accepted the request instance as an argument, and a way to display the results in the console, I had an async Task that returned lyric sets as expected.
- I found it a time-consuming task to properly format the main menu text and borders - beautification of a menu in the console is easier said than done. This, too, took some trial-and-error as I tried different combinations of spaces and border dashes/pipes in conjunction with newline escape characters. Eventually, I found the combination that is properly aligned when the window is fullscreen.
